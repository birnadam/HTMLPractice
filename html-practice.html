                    I'm a former SoCal resident turned NorCal. A dance and basketball enthusiast who is looking to envelope myself in the technology hub in Norcal.
                    I love to travel, eat, and sleep LOL. I was in a long distance relationship with my girlfriend but I'm living with her now that I'm up here.
                    My ambitions are to one day manage a team for software developing. I feel like I am well equipped in leading people collaboratively.
                    It'd be nice to pair those skills with the coding skills I'm looking to obtain at UC Berkeley's coding bootcamp. I'm excited and nervous!
